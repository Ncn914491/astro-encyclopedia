- No user data is uploaded to any server

## Data Security

- All data remains on your device
- No authentication or accounts are required

The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. The App is designed for educational purposes and is suitable for all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Your Rights
